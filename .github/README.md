# Vercel Terraform Provider

This is a custom hacked up variant of `https://github.com/chronark/terraform-provider-vercel` to address
a bug in the vercel_domain resource, and to add branch configuration to the vercel_project resource.

## Warning

This was meant for internal use only, would not recommend anybody use this provider my Go programming
experience is less than a day, so while it works- my changes are terrible.
